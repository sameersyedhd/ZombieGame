Design Rationale:

Zombie Attacks:
	Bite Attack Action & Healing:
	I have added a new ZombieAttackAction, which extends the AttackAction class
	This will be created by a ZombieAttackBehaviour, which extends the AttackBehaviour class
	This will allow me to add the possibility of healing as well as variable accuracy to attacks
	In order to meet the Don't Repeat Yourself criteria we will only need to override the execute method

	Picking Up Weapons:
	In Locations we will have a containsWeapon method which will go through the items arrayList and, if there is an item of type WeaponItem it will return the WeaponItem if it exists or Null otherwise
	If the weapon does exist we will then call the PickUpItemAction, passing the returned WeaponItem in as a parameter and the weapon will be added to the Zombie's inventory
	After this the Zombie will automatically use the weapon as already dictated in the code
	This change does not require the need for new classes, but adds a dependancy as Zombie will create an instance of PickUpItemAction
	

	Saying Brains:
		I have created a new Behaviour called ZombieNoiseBehaviour, which will 			result in the Zombie saying “BRAAAAAAAINS”
			This represents their whole turn and cannot do anything else
		
		This will have a 10% chance of happening
		
		The possibility of it happening will happen at the start of playTurn in 		the Zombie Class
		
		It will be decided by a random number between 1 and 10, if it is 1 then we 		do the ZombieNoiseBehaviour


Beating up the Zombies:
New behaviour called DamageBehaviour deals with determining the outcome of an attack on the Zombie.
When attacked, there is a 25% chance of the zombie losing one of its limbs. 
This will be decided by a random number between 1 and 4, if it's 1 then the zombie will lose a limb. if its 2-4, it will not lose a limb.
Use random number to determine which limb (arm or leg) to remove from the zombie (1 = arm, 2 = leg). If zombie has already lost all arms, then remove a leg and vice versa.

Losing limbs:
Arm - losing arms affect the zombies AttackBehaviour.
Losing one arm, halves its probability of punching and increase its chances of dropping any weapon to 50%. 
Losing both arms results in dropping weapon.
Leg - losing legs affects the zombies WanderBehaviour.
Losing one leg, results in halving its movement speed (moves every second turn).
Losing both legs stops the zombie from moving at all but doesn't affect its attacking behaviour.

where should the limbs drop? next to zombie or at an adjacent location?

Crafting Weapons
A player can use dropped zombie limbs as weapons. A zombie arm/leg can be transformed into a club/mace and therefore the weapon will inherite the advantages associated with it (which is inflicting more damage).
